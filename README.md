- 👋 Hi, I’m @SidWheeler
- 👀 I’m interested in human centred design, psychology, politics, permaculture and sustainable gardening/creating habitats
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use github and getting an overview on localgov drupal for volunteering with Conviction. I'm also learning about Object Oriented UX and as Babbel keeps notifying me that my French is really improving when I haven't touched it for months, I better not disappoint it
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for the criminal justice migration project
- 📫 How to reach me: on sid.wheeler@gmail.com
